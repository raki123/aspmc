# aspmc
(Algebraic) answer set counter based on a treewidth-aware cycle-breaking for normal answer set programs.

For usage on Linux you may also install this software as a pip package via
```
pip install aspmc
```
Documentation for usage as a python module is available [here](https://raki123.github.io/aspmc/). 
Examples for command line usage are available below.

If you have any issues please contact us, or even better create an issue on GitHub.

## Development setup
For developement clone via 
```
git clone --single-branch --branch=main git@github.com:raki123/aspmc.git
```
to avoid the download of the experimental results in branch `results`.

We include a setup bash script `setup.sh` that should automatically perform all steps below that are required to run our code. (Except for providing the c2d and miniC2D binary.)

### Python
* Python >= 3.6

All required modules are listed in `requirements.txt` and can be obtained by running
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Tree Decompositions via flow-cutter
We use [flow-cutter](https://github.com/kit-algo/flow-cutter-pace17) to obtain treedecompositions that are needed for our treedecomposition guided clark completion, obtaining treewidth upperbounds on the programs, variable order generation and more.

It is included as a git submodule.

The submodules can be obtained by running
```
git submodule update --init
```

flow-cutter further needs to be compiled via
```
cd aspmc/external/flow-cutter/
bash build.sh
```


### Knowledge Compilation via d4 or sharpSAT-TD 
We use [d4](https://github.com/raki123/d4) or [sharpSAT-TD](https://github.com/raki123/sharpsat-td) for knowledge compilation. Note that both of these are forks of the original model counters [here](https://github.com/crillab/d4) and [here](https://github.com/Laakeri/sharpsat-td/), respectively. For d4 we added support for smooth compilation and for sharpSAT-TD we used the nicely thought out addition by Tuukka Korhonen and Matti JÃ¤rvisalo to enable weighted model counting over semirings in that we added a custom semiring to compile an sd-DNNF.

Both are also included as a git submodules.

The submodules can be obtained by running
```
git submodule update --init
```

They can then be compiled via 
```
cd aspmc/external/sharpsat-td/
mkdir bin
bash setupdev.sh
cd ../../../
cd aspmc/external/d4/
make -j4
cd ../../../
```

## Optionally: c2d and miniC2D
We also are able to use c2d to obtain d-DNNF representations. 
The c2d binary can be provided under `aspmc/external/c2d/bin/` as `c2d_linux` and can be downloaded from [here](http://reasoning.cs.ucla.edu/c2d/).
The miniC2D binary (and the hgr2htree binary) can be provided under `aspmc/external/miniC2D/bin/linux/` as `miniC2D` (and `hgr2htree`) and can be downloaded from [here](http://reasoning.cs.ucla.edu/minic2d/).

Note that they are only available for research use.

### Examples
These examples are for when the code is downloaded via GitHub.
When using the pip package replace `python main.py` by `aspmc` to obtain the same result.

python main.py -m asp -c -f 
a :- not b.
b :- not a.
```
Reads the program from stdin and counts its models.

```
python main.py -m asp -c -f test/test_cycle.lp
```
Reads the same program from file and counts its models.

#### problog example
```
python main.py -m problog -c -f

b :- a.
query(b).
```
Evaluates the given simple program over the probability semiring.

```
python main.py -m problog -c -s maxplus -f
